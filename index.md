# Glitchfinder

Welcome to Glitchfinder! If this is your first time here, then welcome! The site is still under development, so expect outages and frequent bugs. It's powered via Disqus and a handy little Jekyll forum that's set up to communicate with it. Currently there's only one person working on it; if you're interested in helping develop the site and further everyone's knowledge of glitches, feel free to make some posts!
